A classic game (hangman) with a new friendly face.

This is a collaboration between myself (Andrew Durnall) and a felow Student (Jaroslaw Kopaczewski) at Staffordshire University in the UK where we both study BSc Computer Science (Hons).

We intend to build a web hosted mini game to be played on any device and the game is based on the traditional game of hangman, where a person enters a word, the word is hidden and then a second person(player) tries to guess the word with 8 lives, the 8 lives are represented by petals on a daisy flower that is on screen the entire time, if a player guesses correctly the letter appears in the correct location of the hidden word, if they guess incorrectly a petal falls off the daisy, the game ends when all the petals have fallen or the player guessed the hidden word in full.

This is a completely seperate project to our degree and is just for fun,

We hope you enjoy it.
